## Principle 1: Rust-Based Declarative Shell
**"The user interface is defined through rules and states, not imperative flows."**

### Implementation
- Utilizes declarative Rust frameworks (**Iced** or **Relm4**) to describe UI in terms of *what* should render, not *how*
- State management aligns with Wayland's compositor architecture

### Technical Example
```rust
// Declarative theme application in Rust
match system_state.time_of_day {
    TimeOfDay::Morning => theme.apply("soft-light"),
    TimeOfDay::Day => theme.apply("light"),
    TimeOfDay::Evening => theme.apply("dark"),
    TimeOfDay::Night => theme.apply("black"),
}
```

### Key Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Logic separated from rendering rules (e.g., `if state.theme == "dark"`)
- **Consistency**: UI always reflects system state (windows, themes, night light)
- **Performance**: Parallel-friendly rendering optimization

### Linux Standards Compliance
- Compatible with **Wayland** protocols
- Inspired by **COSMIC DE**'s architecture
